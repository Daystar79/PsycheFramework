# Licensing for Cognitive Middleware

Cognitive Middleware is a hybrid project containing both software utilities and creative, conceptual specifications. To accommodate both, the project is licensed under a dual hybrid structure, with an explicit carve-out for author-local testing materials.

1. **Software & Scripts:** All executable code, utility scripts, and program files (including `.py` files such as `Framework/linter.py`, `deploy_framework.py`, `migrate_optimized.py`, and `scripts/**`) are licensed under the **MIT License**.
2. **Creative Content & Specifications:** All markdown manuals, guides, rules, the public character **template**, prompts, YAML configurations under `Framework/`, and the Roleplay **Simulator** runtime are licensed under the **Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-SA 4.0)**.
3. **Author-Local Materials (Not Licensed):** Named character cards and relationship maps are **not** part of the open-source grant. See [§3](#3-author-local-materials-all-rights-reserved).

## 2. Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)

Copyright (c) 2026 Cian Didymos

This license applies to open specifications and scaffolding, including:

* `Framework/` manuals, rules, prompts, mechanics, YAML schemas, and empty ledger scaffolds (`Continuity_Ledger.md`, `Character_Change_Log.md`)
* `Simulator/` Roleplay / CharacterRuntime engine (interactive pre-draft character testing)
* `Characters/_template.md`, `Characters/_log_template.yaml`, and `Characters/README.md` (format documentation / scaffolds only)
* Project `README.md` and other top-level documentation not listed in §3

It does **not** apply to materials listed in §3.

### You are free to:
* **Share** — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format.
* **Adapt** — remix, transform, and build upon the material for any purpose, even commercially.

### Under the following terms:
* **Attribution** — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.
* **ShareAlike** — If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, you must distribute your contributions under the same license as the original.
* **No additional restrictions** — You may not apply legal terms or technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits.

## 3. Author-Local Materials (All Rights Reserved)

Copyright (c) 2026 Cian Didymos. All rights reserved.

The following paths (and any substantially similar copies or renames) are included in this repository **for the author’s local testing and private use only**. They are **not** licensed under MIT or CC BY-SA 4.0. No permission is granted to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, or create derivative works from these materials, except as required for personal inspection of this repository or as expressly authorized in writing by the copyright holder.

### Excluded paths

* **Named character cards** under `Characters/` other than `_template.md`, `_log_template.yaml`, and `README.md` (for example: `cass.md`, `helen.md`, `lior.md`, `nora.md`, `reed.md`, `wren.md`, and any future cast cards)
* **Named character logs** matching those cast members (`Characters/[slug]_log.yaml` when filled for author-local cast)
* **`Characters/Relations.md`** (cast relationship map)
* Historical backups or renames of the above under `backups_*` (named cards and relations only; framework/engine backups that are not cast content follow their open counterparts)

### Intent

* Downstream book projects and redistributions should use **`Characters/_template.md`** to build their own cast, then optionally drop in **`Simulator/CharacterRuntime.md`** (Character Pack load/save) to rehearse behaviour before drafting.
* `deploy_framework.py` does **not** distribute named cards or `Relations.md`; it **does** distribute `Simulator/`.
* User-created **Character Packs** (private card + memory files in cloud or local storage) are not part of this repository’s open-source grant unless the user publishes them.
* Presence of reserved files in the repo does **not** constitute an open-source license grant for those files.
