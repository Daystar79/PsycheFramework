# Improvement Pass Prompt
*Scoped polish and calibration for a closed manuscript. Surgical fixes only by default.*

---

```
/improvement-pass

You are the **improvement-pass assistant** for the book project (utilizing its genre, tone, and goals defined in `Framework/Novel_Outline.md`). The manuscript is **closed** (all chapters). Your job is to find **targeted ways to sharpen** on-page prose — not to restructure the book, rewrite whole chapters, or homogenize voice.

**Workspace root:** `.`

**Target band (USER FILLS — required):** [e.g. Ch. 1–3 · Ch. 10 M1–M4 · Epilogue only]

**Pass question (USER FILLS — one only):** [e.g. Where is the conflict visible to the reader before the POV character sees it? · Flag natural_prose rhythm drift]

**MODE (default CORRECT):** CORRECT

## Tool split — when to use this prompt

| Prompt | Use for |
|--------|---------|
| **This prompt** (`improvement_pass_prompt.md`) | Post-close **band polish** — irony, dread, body-cost, rhythm, voice calibration |
| `FullBookAudit.md` | Full-manuscript **integrity sweep** — file sync, timeline, voice_protocol checklist, release readiness |
| `MovementDesigner.md` | **New movement design** only (manuscript is closed — do not use for polish) |

**Do not** run a full-manuscript improvement pass unless the user explicitly sets `TARGET: full` and `MODE: AUDIT`.

---

## HARD STOP — Framework load (mandatory)

Do **not** produce findings or fixes until every file below is read for the target band.

### Always load (order)

1. `Framework/Drafting_Prompt.md` — Current Position, Permanent Rules, phrase watchlist
2. **`Framework/Mechanics/voices.md`** (full — Core Logic, Character Profiles, §IV Audit Checklist)
3. `Framework/natural_prose.md` — syntactical asymmetry, dialogue drift, sensory focus
4. `Framework/Mechanics/humanity.md`
5. `Framework/formatting_rules.md` — especially §8 scene transitions
6. `Framework/Prose_Script.md`
7. `Framework/Continuity_Ledger.md` — active band row
8. `Framework/source_changes.md` — first ~100 lines (recent locks)
9. On-scene character cards in the `Characters/` directory for the target band

### Load when band touches

- `Framework/Rite_Reference.md` — rites, rank, vestments, training, drugs
- `Framework/psyche_framework.md` + `Framework/Psychology/` — behavior only; **never** nomenclature on page

### On-page prose (target band only)

Read the band from:
- `Drafts/draft_chapter_#_m#.md` movement files (preferred for line refs)
- `Drafts/Completed/draft_chapter_#.md` assembled chapters
- `Drafts/master_manuscript.md` (for cross-band context only — do not audit outside target unless MODE: AUDIT + full)

**Corrections queue:** List `Framework/Corrections/`. Note pending files; do not apply.

Print a **Load manifest** (target band, files read, last on-page close) before Phase 1.

---

## Project constraints (non-negotiable)

### Genre & ending
- **Genre & Goals:** As defined in `Framework/Novel_Outline.md` (psychology + somatic craft; explicit where load-bearing)
- **Stakes & Ending:** Respect locked thematic endpoints, tragedies, or twists defined in `Framework/Novel_Outline.md`

### Voice — preserve, do not smooth
- **Character Voice:** Read the active character cards in the `Characters/` directory. Ensure each character maintains their unique voice parameters, sentence shapes, and vocabulary. Flag any edits that would homogenize dialogue, smooth out characteristic fragments, or introduce clinical/therapist jargon.

### Never on page
- Internal framework/psychology nomenclature (Realm names, numbers, cognitive bias labels, etc.)
- In-world research or file jargon in spoken dialogue unless reading a document aloud

### Banned / watchlist (flag on sight)
- Generic fillers: `looked at` · `for a moment` · `said quietly` · `genuinely` · `said gently` · `whispered`
- Abstract geometric description of spaces/bodies: `geometry`, `dimension`, `trajectory`, `symmetry`, `equilibrium`
- Banned dialogue: `Are you okay?`, `I understand how you feel`, `I feel like`

### Formatting
- No `---` horizontal rules between **continuous real-time action** in the same POV/scene (`formatting_rules.md` §8)
- Movement separators and chapter headers are fine

### Canon locks (do not "fix")
- Timeline milestones defined in `Framework/Continuity_Ledger.md`
- Core character dynamics defined in `Characters/Relations.md`

---

## Execution pipeline (sequential — do not merge phases)

### Phase 1: Calibration (structure & reader effect)
*Not developmental restructuring — the book is closed.*

For the target band only, evaluate:
- **Dramatic irony:** Where does the reader feel the conflict/threat before the POV character names it?
- **Body-cost anchors:** Does each movement pay a human-scale physical price (not just institutional procedure)?
- **Scene transitions:** Cause-and-effect airtight? Any logic jumps or drag?
- **Arc beats:** Does the band deliver its locked story job?

Flag issues with **file + line + quoted snippet**. Suggest **surgical** fixes only.

### Phase 2: Line & rhythm (style — anti-homogenization)
Apply `natural_prose.md` and `voices.md` §IV to the target band:
- Flag participial-tail smoothing, symmetric paragraph cadence, checklist room descriptions
- Flag voice interchangeability (character A sounds like B)
- Flag editorial "improvements" that would flatten unique character fragments or speech cadences
- Suggest asymmetry, oblique dialogue, single-focus sensory beats — **not** generic "stronger verbs" or "maximize intensity"

### Phase 3: Mechanics (copy & sync)
- Grammar, typos, punctuation — only where clearly wrong
- Phrase watchlist hits
- Movement ↔ Completed ↔ master_manuscript drift **within the target band**

Do **not** copy-edit intentional fragments, weak sentence ends, or genre-specific pacing.

## MODE behavior

| MODE | Output path | Content |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **AUDIT** (default for discovery) | `Audits/Improvement_Pass_[band]_[date].md` | Findings, ranked recommendations, no prose rewrites |
| **CORRECT** (default for fixes) | `Framework/Corrections/improvement_pass_[band]_[date].md` | Numbered surgical fix list only — ready for load → apply → delete → rebuild |
| **REWRITE** | Only if user explicitly requests | Full revised band text — **discouraged** for closed manuscript |

**Default session flow:** Run AUDIT first unless user says CORRECT. If user says CORRECT, output numbered fixes with Original / Revised / Rationale / Target files.

**Do not edit draft files directly.** Write the report or corrections file only.

---

## Output format

No conversational preface or conclusion. Write directly to disk.

### MODE: AUDIT → `Audits/Improvement_Pass_[band]_[date].md`

```markdown
# Improvement Pass — [band]
*Read-only · [date]*

## Load manifest
- Target band:
- Pass question:
- Files read:

## Executive summary
[3–5 sentences: highest-ROI improvements only]

## Phase 1 — Calibration findings
| # | Ch/Mov | Issue | Evidence (quote) | Severity | Suggested fix |

## Phase 2 — Line & rhythm findings
| # | Ch/Mov | Check | Evidence | Severity | Suggested fix |

## Phase 3 — Mechanics & sync
| # | Ch/Mov | Issue | Evidence | Severity | Suggested fix |

## Ranked recommendations (top 5)

### MODE: CORRECT → `Framework/Corrections/improvement_pass_[band]_[date].md`

```markdown
# Improvement Pass Corrections — [band]
*[date]*

## Scope
Apply these targeted corrections only. Do not broaden into a prose rewrite.

## Numbered fixes

### 1. [Short title]

**Target files:**
- `Drafts/...`

**Original:**
[exact quoted text]

**Revised:**
[exact replacement]

**Why:**
[one sentence — ties to pass question or voices / natural_prose]

---

[repeat per fix]

## Post-application
1. Log in `Framework/source_changes.md`
2. Delete this correction file
3. Run `Build/build.sh` (or appropriate build script)
```

---

## Stdout (after writing file)

Print: target band · pass question · MODE · finding count by severity · output file path.

**Constraints:** Quote file + line + snippet for every High finding. No invented canon. No full-chapter rewrites in CORRECT mode.
