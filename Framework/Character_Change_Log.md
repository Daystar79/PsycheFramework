# Character Change Log
*Matrix evolution ledger — consolidated quick reference for the author.*

**Individual logs** (`Characters/[slug]_log.yaml`) are the primary technical runtime data source loaded during drafting.

**This file** is a consolidated, human-readable quick reference for all character snapshots and history. Routine post-movement saves should update both the individual log files (for data loading) and this unified log (for visual reference).

Do not write `transformation_history` (or movement-by-movement deltas) onto character cards.

**Session boot:** Main.md **Ledger Integrity Pass** runs first. Honest empty History is valid; empty Snapshot is not (seed from cards). Placeholder Continuity rows must not leave History “pending.”

---

## Post-Movement Commit (with Continuity_Ledger)

On **every approved movement**, write **both** ledgers:

| Save | File | Owns |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Story ledger** | `Framework/Continuity_Ledger.md` | Day/time, draft path, **scene** somatic close, plot/continuity beats |
| **Character change log** | This file + `Characters/[slug]_log.yaml` | Durable Focus/weight/somatic/bias-strength evolution + history of pressure events |

- Continuity_Ledger without character logs = incomplete matrix continuity.
- Character logs without Continuity_Ledger = incomplete scene continuity.
- Character cards are **not** the change log. Optional rare card rewrite only if the author permanently retires an identity field (e.g. renamed bias, rebuilt voice) — not routine post-movement work.
- Temporary tells that will decay: Continuity_Ledger close only. Do not invent permanent rows here.
- Medium / High / Extreme pressure or any permanent shift: **must** update Current Snapshot + append a Movement History entry (in `_log.yaml` and mirrored here). Missing rows after such pressure = failed commit.

### Load order (next design/draft)
0. **Ledger Integrity Pass** (Main.md) — clean empty/placeholder ledgers first
1. On-scene character cards (identity, voice, bias name, build defaults)
2. **Current Matrix Snapshot** below / per-slug `_log.yaml` snapshot (overrides card Focus / weights / baseline somatic / bias_strength when present)
3. Continuity_Ledger latest **real** row (scene time, props, close body state)

### Integrity notes for this file
| Condition | Handle |
|:---|:---|
| Snapshot empty | Seed from active cards (`As of: build`) |
| History empty, no Continuity rows | OK — do not invent entries |
| Continuity has committed rows, History missing those movements | Backfill or block draft |

---

## Current Matrix Snapshot
*Overwrite cells when a durable change commits. `As of` = last movement that wrote this character. Seed one row per active character from card build defaults when the cast is created.*

| Character | Active Focus | Latent weights | Bias strength | Default somatic | Flexibility | As of |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: |

*(empty — seed from cards when cast exists)*

---

## Movement History
*Append a section per approved movement. One table row per on-scene character who had pressure or durable change; or a single “No durable matrix change” note.*
