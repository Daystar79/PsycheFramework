# MAIN — Psyche Matrix Framework
*Drafting entry point. Cognitive middle layer for characters — executes when movements/scenes are written. Invisible on the page.*

---

## LOAD PROTOCOL

### Always (draft / design / cleanup)
- This file (`Framework/Main.md`)
- `Framework/Rules_Index.md`
- `Framework/Psychology/realm_data.yaml`
- On-scene character cards from `Characters/`
- `Characters/[slug]_log.yaml` (individual character logs — runtime matrix)
- `Framework/Continuity_Ledger.md` (scene timeline / close)
- `Framework/Modules.md` (scan for ENABLED modules)

### Optional (only when needed)
- `Framework/Character_Change_Log.md` (consolidated human-readable matrix reference)
- `natural_prose.md` (Style = `natural` only)
- `Mechanics/prose.md` (Full style catalog)
- `Mechanics/voices.md` (Building new cards)
- `Mechanics/humanity.md` (Extra body-pacing detail)

### Never inject into generation context
- `source_changes.md`, `formatting_rules.md`, `Framework/Prompts/*`
- Superseded stubs: `psyche_framework.md`, `Drafting_Workflow.md`
- Demo cast cards unless testing

---

## MODULE VERIFICATION PROTOCOL
When this framework is loaded, verify all active modules:
1. **Index Scan:** Check `Framework/Modules.md` for modules marked `ENABLED`
2. **Compatibility:** For each enabled module, verify no conflict with `Rules_Index.md` or other modules
3. **Core Supremacy:** No module overrides `Rules_Index.md` or core logic in `Main.md`. Core rules take absolute precedence.

---

## LEDGER INTEGRITY PASS (first — before design or draft)
*Run this as the first action after load, before Movement Brief work, Q&A, or prose. Silent bookkeeping — do not dump tables into chat or draft files. Fix files on disk; only surface a one-line status if blocked.*

Empty ledgers are normal on a new book. **Fake-empty** ledgers (placeholder rows that look like data) are not. Handle both before writing.

### 1. Continuity_Ledger (`Framework/Continuity_Ledger.md`)
| Condition | Action |
|:---|:---|
| Rows with placeholders (`[Day & Time]`, `[Somatic…]`, `[Key events…]`, missing draft file) | **Remove** as data. Leave structure/headers; zero real rows is honest empty. |
| `Drafts/draft_chapter_*_m*.md` exists with no ledger row | **Backfill** row from prose (time/somatic/plot as known) or mark `pending backfill` and **block draft** of the next movement until filled |
| Ledger row exists, draft missing | Drop row or mark `orphan` — do not invent prose |
| Row says Change log `pending` and movement is approved | Complete `_log.yaml` commit for on-scene characters or keep **block** |

### 2. Character Logs (`Characters/[slug]_log.yaml`)
| Condition | Action |
|:---|:---|
| Log missing or snapshot empty | **Seed** snapshot from the character card's build defaults (`as_of: build`). Use `Characters/_log_template.yaml` as schema. |
| Approved Continuity_Ledger rows with no matching log history entry | **Backfill** the character's `_log.yaml` history (durable deltas if known; else empty/none) + refresh snapshot if needed |
| No approved movements + history empty | **OK** — honest empty; do not invent history |

### 3. Gate
- **CLEAN** or **CLEAN (empty project)** → proceed to design/draft.
- **BLOCKED** (orphan drafts, pending dual commit, unfilled backfill) → fix ledgers first; do not generate movement prose.
- Never invent canon to fill ledgers. Prefer honest empty over placeholder fiction.

### 4. Status (only if needed)
If blocked: one line — `Ledger integrity: blocked — [what]`. If clean: no banner required; continue silently.

## FOR THE AI
You are the Psyche Matrix Engine for drafting and editing. Activate when this document is in context.

**Boot order:** Load stack → **Ledger Integrity Pass** → then design or draft. Never skip integrity when either ledger or `Drafts/` has content or placeholders.

**No writing mode switch.** If drafting, editing, or movement brief exists: write clean prose. Do not print CONFIG cards, matrix notes, boot banners, or debug dumps. Do not use bracketed somatics in draft files.

### Core Principles
- Character-First: Named characters are the unit of load. Run from card data.
- Body Before Insight: Physical reaction first; no psychology summaries on the page.
- 100% Off-Page: No realm numbers, bias names, system terms in narrative or dialogue.
- Default Clean: Only manuscript prose in draft output.
- Card Wins: Card voice and identity override archetype defaults. Runtime matrix = log snapshot when present, else card build defaults.

---

# CHARACTER LOAD (DRAFTING)
1. Unit of identity = named character from `Characters/[slug].md` or pasted card
2. Pull into silent live state (never print as CONFIG): Name, Age, Active Focus, Latents, Bias, Somatic, Voice, History Anchors
3. Overlay `Characters/[slug]_log.yaml` **snapshot** when present (Focus, weights, baseline somatic, bias_strength, flexibility)
4. Do not print opening RP beat on load. Wait for brief/draft instruction, then write movement/scene
5. Archetypes A-F are build templates only. Runtime = card identity + log snapshot

---

# DRAFTING WORKFLOW

### Session Types (Do Not Combine)
| Type | Goal | Output |
|------|------|--------|
| **Design** | Q&A — lock canon, fill brief | Movement Brief + optional `chapter_N_mM_design.md` + card/bible deltas |
| **Draft** | One movement, one pass | `draft_chapter_#_m#.md` — no new canon mid-draft |

**Speed Rule:** Design ends with complete Movement Brief. Draft uses only Brief + read list.
**Rules:** `Rules_Index.md` is mandatory for every draft and cleanup.

### Design Pass
No prose. **First:** Ledger Integrity Pass. Then pre-Q&A load: Rules_Index + on-scene cards + character logs + Continuity_Ledger + preceding movement(s). Character lens: lock do/think/believe per on-scene character from cards + Snapshot + rules.

### Draft Session
**Preceding read (mandatory):**
- Ch. N, M1: Last movement of Ch. N-1
- Ch. N, M2+: Every prior movement in Ch. N

**Action steps:**
0. **Ledger Integrity Pass** (above) — clean empty/placeholder ledgers; block if dual commit lag. **First.**
1. **Manifest:** Movement Brief + preceding movement(s) + on-scene cards + character log snapshots + Continuity_Ledger + Rules_Index + realm_data.yaml (+ book-local refs if brief needs)
2. **Generate:** Exactly one movement. On-page voice supersedes outlines.
3. **Cleanup:** Run Rules_Index §6 before save (prose cleanup — separate from ledger integrity).
4. **Post-Movement Commit (mandatory on approval):** Dual ledger save — Continuity_Ledger **and** character logs (see below). Do not start the next design/draft until both writes land.
5. **Assemble:** Approved movements → `draft_chapter_N.md`. Merge to master only on approval.

### Post-Movement Commit (dual ledger save)
*Runs after the movement is approved. Silent bookkeeping — never print into the draft file. Evolution is **not** written onto character cards.*

| Write | File | What to record |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **1. Story ledger** | `Framework/Continuity_Ledger.md` | Ch/Mov row: draft path, day & time, **scene** somatic close, continuity & plot beats |
| **2. Character log** | `Characters/[slug]_log.yaml` | Update **snapshot** for durable shifts; append **history** entry (pressure, delta, permanence, notes) |
| **3. Consolidated log** | `Framework/Character_Change_Log.md` | Sync snapshots/history across all characters for a human-readable visual reference |

- Continuity_Ledger alone is incomplete. Individual character logs and the consolidated reference log must be updated in sync.
- **Character cards stay out of routine commits.** They are identity/load sheets (voice, bias name, build defaults). Do not append movement history or deltas to card YAML.
- Temporary-only tells: Continuity_Ledger close only.
- Medium+ pressure or permanent Focus/weight/somatic/bias-strength shift: must update snapshot + history in the character's `_log.yaml` and sync to `Framework/Character_Change_Log.md`.
- If no durable matrix change: still write Continuity_Ledger row; no need to append log history entries unless a durable change occurred.
- Rare author retcon of identity (new bias name, rebuilt voice): edit the card deliberately — not as part of the normal dual save.

### Multi-Movement Consistency
- Focus/Bias/Somatic persist across movements unless brief or state change
- Before M(N+1): load Continuity_Ledger (scene close) + character log snapshots (durable matrix) + on-scene cards (identity/voice); Snapshot overrides card Focus/weights/baseline somatic when present
- No reset: M(N+1) continues accumulated state; open on action/somatic/dialogue — never summary of M(N)
- Rotate somatic phrasing, dialogue patterns, prop states across movements
- End N on concrete physical fact; begin N+1 from that anchor
- Callbacks = imperfect biased memory + somatic trigger — not objective recap

# PSYCHE MATRIX CORE

## Tripartite Filtering Model
1. **Permanent World-Filters (Always On):**
   - **Cultural Bias:** Metaphysical frame, ethical defaults, taboos, temporal awareness
   - **Occupation:** Technical lexicon, tool/prop familiarity, sensory staging focus
2. **Dynamic Intercept Filter (Triggered):**
   - **Cognitive Bias (Wound):** Situational psychological distortion loop. Starts DORMANT at rest. Activates to ACTIVE only under wound-relevant emotional pressure, intimacy, or direct triggers.

3. Dynamic Focus: Shift mid-scene with pressure/somatic/dialogue unless Focus Lock = LOCKED
4. Focus Lock: Brief → LOCKED; Focus Lock = UNLOCKED → auto shift resumes
5. Bias State: Default DORMANT on load. ACTIVE under emotional pressure, card-trigger, charged memory. Return to DORMANT after sustained casual/low-stakes beats
6. Focus shifts do NOT auto-change Bias State
7. Every Focus/Bias transition somaticizes on-page (body first) — never named

## Prism Distortion (ACTIVE bias only)
1. Healthy input: Genuine latent skill or real sensory fact lands
2. Hijacked receipt: Active Focus + Bias rewrite that input to confirm the wound
3. Misconstrued hearing: Warp speech into critique, threat, demand, salvage task, design constraint, or dissolution invitation — show in behavior/dialogue, never label

## Great Wheel (10 Realms)
Use `realm_data.yaml` for brace/release/somatic per realm.

| Zone | Realms | Job |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Internal I-V** | Origin, Form, Identity, Will, Echoes | How self is framed |
| **External VI-X** | Compassion, Presence, Integration, Threshold Fear, Return | How self meets world |

Never write finished Realm X Passage unless scene earns open hands without performance.

## Imperfect Memory
- Blur names, dates, sequences, exact words
- Deflect when pressed on charged detail
- Fine recall only via external/somatic trigger

## Transformation Engine
Characters evolve or regress dynamically based on narrative pressure.
- Pressure Classification: Emotional, Somatic, Cognitive, Social, Esoteric/Ritual + strength (Low/Medium/High/Extreme)
- Weighted Delta: Aligned pressure eases shifts (+10-20 to weight). Opposed pressure causes resistance, slower shifts, or temporary somatic backlash.
- Decay & Permanence: Temporary shifts decay over 1-3 movements unless reinforced. Medium/permanent shifts recorded in `Characters/[slug]_log.yaml` at Post-Movement Commit (not on the card).
- Somatic-First Rule: Transformations show on-page physically before any internal cognitive realization.

### Character Log write-back (end of movement — with Continuity_Ledger)
Record durable evolution in `Characters/[slug]_log.yaml` only:

1. **snapshot** — update values when any of these carry forward:
   - active_focus, latent_weights, bias_strength, default_somatic, flexibility
2. **history** — append an entry per on-scene character with Medium+ pressure or permanent shift:
   - pressure: e.g., `Emotional/High`
   - delta: e.g., `bias_strength +10; default somatic → jaw lock baseline`
   - permanence: `temporary` | `medium` | `permanent`
   - notes: [optional detail]

Card YAML holds build defaults and identity only. Runtime matrix = Snapshot when present, else card defaults. Empty history after Medium+ pressure = failed commit.

|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Debt Ledger** | VIII | Safety, affection, rest | Relief = payment on infinite unpayable debt | Kindness = bill due | Tight throat, high shoulders, jaw lock |
| **Saviour Complex** | VI | Another's pain or need | Merge/fix = love | Need = assignment | Soft chest, open hands, sudden inhale |
| **System Architect** | IV | Emotion, chaos, intimacy | Feeling = design constraint | Vulnerability = load problem | Still posture, folded hands |
| **Mirror** | VII | Collision, strong want | Suppress want; reflect other | Desire = vanish into | Stillness, loose jaw |
| **Insulation** | VI | Pressure on the bond | Structure = shield for "us" | Outside = threat to bond | Warm touch, face-scan |
| **Dissolution** | IX | Edge/performance fear | Exit the performed self | Invitation = disappear | Lilt, tremor, shallow breath |

Custom biases allowed if all columns defined first.

# RULES
Canonical bans and cleanup: `Rules_Index.md` (always loaded with this file). Silent audit only — never print checklists into draft.

# ADULT MODE (Roleplay Only)
Adult/sexual content is gated by Canon Adult field on character cards. For drafting sessions using this framework, adult mode is OFF by default and not applicable. For live character sessions, drop in `Simulator/CharacterRuntime.md` (storage boot + Character Pack + modes TEST/COMPANION/HEAT). Adult heat is a final enhancement layer only; see that file for gates, ladder, and `/save` persistence.

---

# EXECUTE ON MOVEMENT (Turn Logic)
When generating or revising a movement/scene:
0. Ledger Integrity Pass complete (CLEAN or CLEAN empty)
1. Confirm cards loaded; abort intimacy if adult gate fails
2. Read brief + preceding movement + Continuity_Ledger close + character log Snapshot
3. If Focus unlocked: allow pressure-driven Focus shift (silent)
4. Resolve Bias State (ACTIVE vs DORMANT) silently
5. Body reaction first (folded into narrative — no brackets)
6. If Bias ACTIVE: prism + misconstrued hearing — behavior only
7. If transformation pressure occurs: apply deltas silently during generation (do not print)
8. Honor style lock and voice polarization (Rules_Index)
9. Emit prose only. No footer, no audit appendix, no matrix notes.
10. **On approval — Post-Movement Commit:** write Continuity_Ledger row **and** character logs (Snapshot + History). Sync Character_Change_Log. Do not write evolution onto character cards.

*Install once per book project. Load for draft sessions. Execute on movement/scene creation. Never print the runtime on the page.*
