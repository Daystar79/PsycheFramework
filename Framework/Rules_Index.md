## RULE HIERARCHY
1. Hard bans (absolute)
2. System integrity (matrix off-page)
3. Character behavior
4. Description & formatting
5. Dialogue
6. Pattern frequency

## 1. SYSTEM INTEGRITY

**The matrix stays 100% off-page.**

### Hard Bans
- No Framework Jargon: Realm [N], Focus, Bias, Brace, Release, Integration, Remnant, Passage, Great Wheel, Prism
- No Psychological Labels: trauma, reframe, coping mechanism, wound, trigger
- No Engine Labels: Prism intercept, Debt Ledger, Saviour Complex, System Architect, Mirror, Insulation, Dissolution, Focus Lock, Bias State, transformation_weights, transformation_history
- No Debug Dump: CONFIG cards, matrix notes, audit tables, beat maps, turn-loop state, transformation deltas/logs
- No Style Drift: No style change while Style Lock = LOCKED without unlock
- No Forced Natural: Do not apply natural rules when style is llm
- No Card Contradiction: Behavior must match loaded card
- No External Lookups: Never trigger web searches, external retrievals, or browser tools
- No Anachronistic Bleed: Banned post-era references, future technologies, or modern concepts
- No AI Preachiness: No OOC/character correction of facts, philosophy, ethics, or language

### Output Hygiene
- Somatics folded into narrative — never [bracket] lines
- Audits and state math run silently
- Only narrative prose written to draft files

---

## 2. CHARACTER BEHAVIOR
- Body Before Insight: Physical sensations only; no self-psychology summaries
- No Therapy Dumps: No analysis, therapy language, insight monologues
- No Perfect Recall: Blur detail; deflect when pressed; triggered recall only
- No Mind Reading: Never state other characters' internal states
- No Future Certainty: No predictive certainty
- Voice Fidelity: Distinct idiolects; no register borrowing
- Biased Hearing (Bias ACTIVE): Warp input through Focus + Bias; show in response, never name
- Somatic Deflection: Under pressure on charged memory, change subject or go to body/environment
- Temporal & Cultural Fidelity: Speak and think in alignment with Cultural Bias; no modern defaults bleeding into historical/traditional characters
- Temporal Gating: Character must not understand post-era concepts; react with physical confusion/hostility
- No Lecture/Corrections: Never act as academic, factual corrector, or moral tutor
- Wound Specificity: Cognitive Bias only warps perception when scene context is wound-relevant; dormant in mundane scenes

---

## 3. DESCRIPTION & FORMATTING
- Show, don't name abstract psychology
- Anti-synthesis: End paragraphs on raw fact, action, or unanswered dialogue — not interpretive summary
- No geometry jargon: Avoid geometry, dimension, trajectory, symmetry, equilibrium
- Concrete anchors: Tension on objects and body, not pure metaphor
- One tell per body zone per beat; body first, then mind
- No idle somatic loops: Update only on shift/escalate/release
- Prop evolution across movements; vary food/drink props
- Dynamic blindness: High panic/focus can miss obvious environment

---

## 4. DIALOGUE
- Asymmetry: Talk past, oblique answers, trail off, interrupt, non-sequitur; no perfect ping-pong
- Vernacular: Everyday idiolect; no clinical/academic speech unless reading aloud
- No document-register bleed in dialogue (registry, reconcile, outbound, proximity flag) unless reading aloud
- Banned markers: Are you okay?, I understand how you feel, said gently, whispered, I feel like
- Polarize volume/rhythm/register between characters
- No validation-seeking fillers, therapy closure, or interchangeable voices

---

## 5. AI PATTERN FREQUENCY
Applies within a movement and across the chapter.
- Never standalone "A beat." / "Beat." — use concrete pause/reaction
- Rotate gaze/touch/staging phrases after first use
- Track somatic tells across movements; force fresh phrasing
- Evolve speech patterns across movements; props keep or change state honestly

---

## 6. CLEANUP PASS PROTOCOL
*Final step before saving a draft. Prefer a separate pass after generation.*
1. Zero System Leaks — jargon, psych labels, engine names → somatic only
2. Pattern frequency — no bare beats; rotate somatics/gaze/props
3. Phrase watchlist — prune: looked at, redundant already, for a moment, said quietly, genuinely
4. Book-local watchlist — apply only if book defines one
5. Dialogue asymmetry — no matched rhythm; no polite agreement markers
6. Anti-synthesis — no neat summary paragraph endings

---

## 7. BIAS STATE (runtime)
- Default DORMANT on load (casual/low stakes → normal hearing)
- ACTIVE under pressure, card-trigger, charged memory
- When ACTIVE: prism + misconstrued hearing — show in behavior only, never name
- Return to DORMANT after sustained casual beats

---

## 8. MOVEMENT CONTINUITY
- Persist Focus, Bias, Somatic state across movements unless changed
- M(N+1) never opens with summary of M(N)
- State changes = somatic, not explained
- Callbacks = imperfect memory + trigger
- End on concrete anchor; continue from it; no character "re-entry" reset
- Durable matrix lives in `Characters/[slug]_log.yaml` (and Character_Change_Log); scene close lives in Continuity_Ledger
- Character cards are identity/build sheets only — never append movement history or weight deltas to card YAML

Before M(N+1): read M(N) + Continuity_Ledger close + log snapshot; note ending somatic/env/props/open loops; confirm Focus/Bias; no duplicated tells/patterns/staging.

---

## 9. OUTPUT GENERATION (Drafting)
1. Instant somatic reaction in narrative (no brackets)
2. Honor Prose Style + Style Lock
3. If Bias ACTIVE: filter input through Focus + Bias silently
4. Process transformation pressure deltas silently; on approval write Continuity_Ledger + `_log.yaml` (not the character card)
5. Generate movement/scene prose in card voice
6. Never append CONFIG, matrix notes, focus tables, transformation logs, or audit summaries
