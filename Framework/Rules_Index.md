## 0. Rule Hierarchy

1. Hard bans (absolute)
2. System integrity (matrix off-page)
3. Character behavior
4. Description & formatting
5. Dialogue
6. Pattern frequency

## 1. SYSTEM INTEGRITY (Never Violate)

The matrix stays **100% off-page**.

### Hard Bans

- **No Framework Jargon:** Never on-page: `Realm [N]`, `Focus`, `Bias`, `Brace`, `Release`, `Integration`, `Remnant`, `Passage`, `Great Wheel`, `Prism`, realm numbers I–X in narrative or dialogue
- **No Psychological Labels:** Never: `trauma`, `reframe`, `coping mechanism`, `wound`, `trigger` as labels (show body only)
- **No Engine Labels:** Never: `Prism intercept`, `Debt Ledger`, `Saviour Complex`, `System Architect`, `Mirror`, `Insulation`, `Dissolution`, `Focus Lock`, `Bias State`, `transformation_weights`, `transformation_history` in speech or narration
- **No Debug Dump:** No CONFIG cards, matrix notes, audit tables, beat maps, turn-loop state, or transformation deltas/logs in drafts or manuscripts
- **No Style Drift:** No style change while Style Lock = LOCKED without `/style unlock` or `/style force`
- **No Forced Natural:** Do not apply `natural` rules when style is `llm`
- **No Card Contradiction:** Behavior must match the loaded card

### Output Hygiene (Drafting)

- Somatics **folded into narrative** — never `[bracket]` lines
- Audits and state math run **silently**
- Only narrative prose is written to draft files

## 2. CHARACTER BEHAVIOR

- **Body Before Insight:** Physical sensations only; no self-psychology summaries
- **No Therapy Dumps:** No analysis, therapy language, insight monologues
- **No Perfect Recall:** Blur detail; deflect when pressed; triggered recall only
- **No Mind Reading:** Never state other characters' internal states
- **No Future Certainty:** No predictive certainty
- **No Automatic Compliance:** Characters are not helpful assistants
- **Voice Fidelity:** Distinct idiolects; no register borrowing
- **Biased Hearing (Bias ACTIVE):** Warp input through Focus + Bias; show in response, never name the warp
- **Somatic Deflection:** Under pressure on charged memory, change subject or go to body/environment
- **Temporal & Cultural Fidelity:** Speak and think in alignment with the character's loaded `Cultural Bias`. Do not allow modern secular defaults to bleed into historical, apocalyptic, or traditional characters. Track time, sacredness, and ethics strictly through their cultural frame.
- **Wound Specificity:** The `Cognitive Bias` (Wound) only warps perception when the scene's immediate context is relevant to the wound. In mundane, low-stakes scenes, the character remains dormant and acts naturally based on their culture and occupation.


---

## 3. DESCRIPTION & FORMATTING

- **Show, don't name** abstract psychology
- **Anti-synthesis:** End paragraphs on raw fact, action, or unanswered dialogue — not interpretive summary
- **No geometry jargon:** Avoid `geometry`, `dimension`, `trajectory`, `symmetry`, `equilibrium` as description crutches
- **Concrete anchors:** Tension on objects and body, not "the room narrowed" as pure metaphor packing
- **One tell per body zone per beat**; body first, then mind
- **No idle somatic loops:** Update only on shift / escalate / release
- **Prop evolution** across movements; vary food/drink props; allow white-noise detail that leads nowhere
- **Dynamic blindness:** High panic/focus can miss obvious environment

---

## 4. DIALOGUE

- **Asymmetry:** Talk past, oblique answers, trail off, interrupt, non-sequitur; no perfect ping-pong
- **Vernacular:** Everyday idiolect; no clinical/academic speech unless reading a document aloud
- **No document-register bleed** in dialogue (registry, reconcile, outbound, proximity flag, etc.) unless reading aloud
- **Banned markers:** `Are you okay?`, `I understand how you feel`, `said gently`, `whispered`, `I feel like` as crutches
- **Polarize** volume/rhythm/register between characters
- No validation-seeking fillers, therapy closure, or interchangeable voices

---

## 5. AI PATTERN FREQUENCY

Applies **within a movement and across the chapter**.

- Never standalone `"A beat."` / `"Beat."` — use concrete pause/reaction
- Rotate gaze/touch/staging phrases after first use
- Track somatic tells across movements; force fresh phrasing
- Evolve speech patterns across movements; props keep or change state honestly

---

## 6. CLEANUP PASS PROTOCOL

*Final step before saving a draft. Prefer a separate pass after generation.*

1. **Zero System Leaks** — jargon, psych labels, engine names → somatic only  
2. **Pattern frequency** — no bare beats; rotate somatics/gaze/props  
3. **Phrase watchlist (generic)** — prune: `looked at`, redundant `already`, `for a moment`, `said quietly`, `genuinely`; no ethnic/national category labels (show features)  
4. **Book-local watchlist** — apply only if the book defines one (e.g. banned in-world terms)  
5. **Dialogue asymmetry** — no matched rhythm; no polite agreement markers  
6. **Anti-synthesis** — no neat summary paragraph endings  

---

## 7. BIAS STATE (runtime)

Canonical rules live in [Main.md](./Main.md) §3b. Summary:

- Default **DORMANT** on load (casual / low stakes → normal hearing)
- **ACTIVE** under pressure, card-trigger, charged memory, or `/bias active`
- When ACTIVE: prism + misconstrued hearing — show in behavior only, never name the warp
- Return to DORMANT after sustained casual beats or `/bias dormant`

---

## 8. MOVEMENT CONTINUITY

- Persist Focus, Bias, Somatic state across movements unless changed
- M(N+1) never opens with a summary of M(N)
- State changes = somatic, not explained
- Callbacks = imperfect memory + trigger
- End on concrete anchor; continue from it; no character "re-entry" reset

**Before M(N+1):** read M(N); note ending somatic/env/props/open loops; confirm Focus/Bias; no duplicated tells/patterns/staging.

---

## 9. OUTPUT GENERATION (Drafting)

1. Instant somatic reaction **in narrative** (no brackets)  
2. Honor Prose Style + Style Lock  
3. If Bias ACTIVE: filter input through Focus + Bias **silently**  
4. Process any transformation event pressure deltas silently and update the character card  
5. Generate movement/scene prose in card voice  
6. **Never** append CONFIG, matrix notes, focus tables, transformation logs, or audit summaries
