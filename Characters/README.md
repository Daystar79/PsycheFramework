# Characters Directory

Named fictional people are the **unit of load**. Archetypes A–F are voice/matrix templates only ([Main.md](../Framework/Main.md) §5, [voices.md](../Framework/Mechanics/voices.md)).

## Card format

Character cards are **pure YAML** (`.md` extension for tooling compatibility):

- Entire card is a single YAML document between `---` fences
- Structured fields: identity, psyche matrix, transformation tracking, `depth_of_knowledge`, `voice`, `history_anchors`, `scene_seeds`
- One-line load protocol after the closing `---`
- No duplicate markdown tables — the YAML is the source of truth

## Drafting flow

1. Author names on-scene characters.
2. System loads `Characters/[slug].md` (or a pasted card).
3. Silent live state from the card: Focus, Latents, Bias, Somatic, and Voice.
4. [Main.md](../Framework/Main.md) + [Rules_Index.md](../Framework/Rules_Index.md) + [realm_data.yaml](../Framework/Psychology/realm_data.yaml) execute on movement/scene — no bare archetype letter.

## Files

- [`_template.md`](./_template.md) — **public** scaffold; copy for new characters (CC BY-SA 4.0)
- [`README.md`](./README.md) — this file (public format docs)
- Demo cards (`reed`, `helen`, `cass`, `wren`, `nora`, `lior`) — **author-local testing only**; not open-licensed; not deployed to other book folders
- [`Relations.md`](./Relations.md) — **author-local** cast relationship map; not open-licensed; not deployed

See [LICENSE.md](../LICENSE.md) §3 for the carve-out. Downstream projects should start from `_template.md` only.

## Adding a novel character

1. Copy `_template.md` → `Characters/[slug].md` (or run [character_builder_prompt.md](../Framework/Prompts/character_builder_prompt.md))
2. Fill YAML fields: **age**, **canon_adult**, physical, cultural_bias
3. Fill psyche matrix from Main + realm_data.yaml
4. Voice: nearest A–F base under `voice:`, then override with idiolect on the card
5. Drafting: load Main + Rules_Index + realm_data.yaml + this card
